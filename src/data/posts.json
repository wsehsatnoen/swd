Each day I woke up and found a hike that I would enjoy the sunrise to. The first one was Hidden Lake and OH MY GOD was it beautiful. Not only that but I was very cold with my pants and sweatpants on. Day two was the long hike day! Wend up to the garden wall and hiked along the highland trail, 7 miles from Logans Pass to the Granite Park Chatel. The idea of walking through a forest that high up was phenominal!! Finally, the last full day, I hiked up to the Swift Current Fire Lookout, hurting my knees in the process, but I would do it again in a heartbeat. The views from the top were breathtaking. This was the trip of a lifetime (and yes I did go alone if you were wondering). Glacier? Check!"

        "data": "I have been putting off making one of these for a while simply because I didn't think I was capable of it. But today I just took that leap of faith and starting doing it! It came out nicely and I am excited to see what I can add to it. First I started off with making the home page a single web app. I didn't like the idea of linking between pages and wanted to keep the user in one location. Thus, I make the button that you see up top and wanted them to feel like actual buttons that you press in using the box-shadow. Next, I made the container that holds what the buttons will be changing between. At the point of writing this, I still need to fill in the other tabs but today I conpleted the blog post portion that I can add to! We'll see where this takes me and I'll look back at this post and enjoy the journey I embarked."
